          I was born and grew up in Brazil, in a small town at the exact center
          of Bahia state. My experience with computers started when my parents,
          both high school teachers, needed a computer to work. They bought a
          white IBM Windows 98 PC, which I played games and learned a lot from,
          enjoyed every second of it. Knowing that I would end up working in
          tech wasn't a stretch üòâ.
        </p>
        <p>
          As time passes I started to study Computer Engineering to after find
          out that coding itself is what suits me more, so I made the change to
          Computer Science. In the meantime I was learning Web Development and
          started making games and websites for fun, to later decide to do this
          professionally, and here I am üñêÔ∏è.
        </p>
        <p>
          My other big passions are Music, Crypto and Games. As described
          before, I started coding building games as well as websites, and to
          this day gaming is a big passion of mine.
