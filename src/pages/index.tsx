      "I was born and grew up in Brazil, in a small town at the exact center of the great Bahia state. My experience with computers started when my parents, both hight school teachers, needed a computer to work. They bought a white IBM Windows 98 PC, which I played games and learned a lot from, enjoyed every second of it. Knowing that I would end up working with tech wasn't a stretch.",
      "As time passes I started to study Computer Engineering to after find out that coding itself is what suits me more, so I make the change to Computer Science. In the meantime I learned the basics of Web Development and started making games and websites for fun, to later decide to do this professionally, and here I am. ",
      "My other big passions are Music, Crypto and Games. As I described before, I started coding building games as well as websites, and until this day gaming is a big passion of mine. While working I listen a lot of music, and this are some of my favorite Playlists.",
